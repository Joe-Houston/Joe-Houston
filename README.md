### Greetings Fellow Githubers! My name is Joe Houston, welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm a problem solver, how can I help you?

## Here's a little bit about myself

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... I'm currently in the process of pivoting my career into the tech world. I have not quite found my niche yet but I am about to begin my first project outside of the codecademy course I started a couple months ago. I will be working with my friend Thomas who has turned out to be somewhat of a mentor during my transition, he is web developer focused on front-end engineering. I will keep everyone updated as the project progresses and share what I can with the public.  Needless to say, I am very excited to begin this project as it will allow me to apply many of the techniques I have learned through the codecademy web developement course.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... Although I have a background in Finance and Accounting, in the recent years I have been able to teach myself VBA (Visual Basic Application), SQL, and XML. Over the past few months I have been taking the web development course at Codecademy. Within Codecademy's course I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Gitbash. I am currently learning REACT and JSX. As I stated before, I am excited to apply these methods to a new project I will be working with a colleague on... time to start applying what I have learned! 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... I would be eager to work on any fairly straighforward projects anyone may need some help with. As of now, I would most likely work at no charge in order to apply more of what I have learned recently and to help build my portfolio.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ... Practice. If you or anyone you may know needs help with a project and are willing to teach/guide me a bit with the project, I would love to help out. Currently I am trying to learn how web applications are built in today's climate and would love to learn anything I can from anyone who is willing to teach it right now.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... My background. I started my career as a temporary consultant in Chicago which gave me the advantage of working with many different industries, people, and software. Some people may see this as a weakness in my early career but I feel this very scenario gave me the strengths I build on today. Those strengths being able to learn on the fly, collaborate with all varieties of people, and a knack for streamlining processes.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... Feel free to email me at joseph.houston777@gmail.com. You can also check out my background at my LinkedIn profile here https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-houston-5a1a7739/.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I moved to Costa Rica at the beginning of 2020 to learn Spanish and volunteer. Covid 19 had other plans for us all so I moved back to the states in April in order to be close to my family during this difficult time.

**Take Care of Yourself!**
